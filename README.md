# HomeKit Venetian & Roller Blinds

Powered by Raspberry Pis with HAP-NodeJS and 3D printer controller boards such as the  BTT SKR Pico and the BTT Manta E3EZ.

Experiment in Domain-Driven Design (e.g. Gateway-API-Firmware) where the Firmware State Machine consumes commands from the Gateway layer (HomeKit Accessory Protocol) via the API (RPC running on UART between the Pi and the 3D printer controller board.)

Repository name is not capital-A Agile.
